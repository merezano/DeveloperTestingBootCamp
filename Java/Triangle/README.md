#Myer's Triangle Problem

**Reference**: *The Art of Software Testing*, 2nd ed., by Glenford Myers. (2004).

The program reads three integer values from an input dialog. The three values represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program displays a message stating whether the triangle is **scalene** (all sides have different lengths), **isosceles** (two sides have the same length), or **equilateral** (all sides have the same length).
